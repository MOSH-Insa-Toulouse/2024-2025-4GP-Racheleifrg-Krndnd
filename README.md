# Project Description

The aim of this project is to determine the main characteristics of a low-tech constraint sensor, as introduced in the paper “Pencil Drawn Strain Gauges and Chemiresistors on Paper” by Cheng-Wei Lin et al.,2014, and to compare them with those of an industrial flex sensor. To do so, we used a bench test.
